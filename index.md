Currently exploiting the possibilities of large scale data analysis for research of women's health at [Natural Cycles](https://www.naturalcycles.com/), Stockholm.

During my academic career as an experimental physicist, I worked in areas such as [cosmic particle physics](https://www.auger.org/) and [next-generation biological microscopes](http://testalab.org/). I made the jump to the data science world in 2018.

Interested in all things stats, data science and visualization.
