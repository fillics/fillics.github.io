Instrument integration Python software for microscopy.

## Motivation

State-of-the-art optical microscopy requires coordinated control of several instruments: cameras, photodetectors, lasers, shutters, etc., which is typically achieved via custom routines running on a PC and AD/DA converters. Currently, the most popular environment for instrument control has proprietary and closed software. However, in the last years, there has been a growing interest in Python. Instrumentation could benefit from the language because it is cross-platform, free, open-source and also because there is a massive set of ready-to-use high-level libraries, including key libraries for machine learning and deep learning methods.

## Tormenta

Within this context we developed *Tormenta*, an open-source modular, flexible Python software for the control of optical microscopes and adaptable to any kind
of imaging experiment. It consists of a graphical user interface along with several modules to control common microscopy hardware such as lasers, cameras, photon detectors and cameras. It also includes features such as large data set handling, a focus stabilization module, and routines for background subtraction, among others.

## Resources

The version specifically dedicated to widefield microscopes was presented in the paper Barabas, Masullo, Stefani, *Note: Tormenta: An open source Python-powered control software for camera based optical microscopy*, Review of Scientific Instruments, 2016 ([Link](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4972392)). The code is hosted at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fedebarabas/tormenta).

Lately, we adapted the software to scanning microscopes and included new functionalities. This version is hosted at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fedebarabas/Tempesta).
