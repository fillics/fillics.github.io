## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
I have always liked to keep track of everything I did, such as trips, experiences, and everyday life. I almost wrote every kind of thing happened to me in the last years
in order to remember them better and to fix some important moments. <br />
I have decided to do the same thing for my university life as well because I think it might be useful to someone who chooses the same path as me. <br />

# The EIT Digital Master School, narrated by a student 👨🏻‍🎓 <a name="eitdigital"></a>
I graduated in Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano in _July 2022_, after almost three really hard and intense years, full of satisfaction, but also crisis. <br />

<br />
At the beginning of the last year of the Bachelor, I did not really know what to do after the graduation: I was sure to continue
studying IT-related topics and my biggest desire was to study abroad. I was born and raised in Milan and I felt the need to change 
air (also because of smog 😷) and city. <br />
All of my friends wanted to continue to study Computer Science (Master School) at Politecnico di Milano. 
It seemed to me the only option, until a friend of mine told me about EIT Digital and the possibility of attending a **Double Degree Program**. <br />

I have never heard about it, so I started looking for any kind of information on [their website]((https://www.eitdigital.eu)), and I found it immediately interesting.

## What is EIT? <a name="whatiseit"></a>
### Two Years, Two Countries, Two Degrees <br />
>The EIT Digital Master School offers a two-year programme that lets you study at two world-class universities located in two
different European countries. What's more, you get to build a  tailor-made curriculum based on your unique skills and interests.
We offer double degrees, each of which combines technical competences with practical skills in innovation and entrepreneurship.

They have different programmes: **Data Science**, **CyberSecurity**, **Fintech**, **Autonomous System**, 
**Cloud and Network Infrastructures**, **Embedded Systems and Human Computer Interaction and Design** (HCID). (more info [here](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu)) <br />

I have always been fascinated by data and stats, so I have chosen to apply for [Data Science](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/data-science).

- Second year in KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm (Sweden)
