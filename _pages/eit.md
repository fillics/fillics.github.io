# The EIT Digital Master School, narrated by a student. 👨🏻‍🎓
I graduated in Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano in July 2022, after almost three years really intense and tough. <br />

At the beginning of the last year of the Bachelor, I did not really know what to do after the graduation. All of my friends
wanted to continue to study Computer Science (Master School) at Politecnico di Milano. It seemed to me the only option, until
a friend of mine told me about EIT Digital and the possibility of attending a **Double Degree Program**. <br />

I have never heard about it, so I started looking for any kind of information on [their website]((https://www.eitdigital.eu)) and I found it immediately interesting.

### What is EIT?
EIT Digital selects the best European students, who can access this double master's degree program and attend the two years in two different European universities. <br />

They have different programmes: **Data Science**, **CyberSecurity**, **Fintech**, **Autonomous System**, 
**Cloud and Network Infrastructures**, **Embedded Systems and Human Computer Interaction and Design** (HCID). (more info [here](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu)) <br />

I have always been fascinated by data and stats, so I have chosen to apply for [Data Science](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/data-science).
